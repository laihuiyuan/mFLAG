Or someone seeking the light.
No man could wish more.
Too fast for a bear.
And they shot his heart.
Could be days, could be a few weeks.
No more cheering screams.
Like something boiled into butter over margarine.
Sam's stomach began to answer for him.
I wanted to run.
I wanted to walk.
Shook his head and tried to clear it.
Thirteen years had passed.
How could it be so close?
This could be the real world.
The sight of her body in water.
He wished to believe.
Quick feet, slow fists.
It was too far away.
Ah, the smell of fear.
It had come with them.
And what a dance it was.
The waiting unnerved him.
Almost like nothing had changed.
And the kissing intensified.
His eyes narrowed and he beckoned.
And it gave her the will to live.
Not before I reach it.
He breathed the name.
Danger, not near, but not far.
A place made for a miracle.
How seductive the possibility of utter change.
To lie beneath the stars.
Heard fury wanted to talk to me.
An easy afternoon's ride, under normal circumstances.
How far could it go on?
Someone was trying to get in.
It had no logic.
A window to the world.
A word that stood for freedom.
It felt the same.
It had no meaning.
A king in waiting.
Trenches had been for them.
The earth is in war, he thought.
Just a breath of seasoning.
The carefree ride ended.
It was so close.
None of it was here now.
A mirage, she reminded herself steadily.
A head filled with hope.
A cleansing of blood.
It was beyond death.
Like a body waiting for its head.
It was too far away.
This dream was real, she realized suddenly.
I thought about the night.
Never been on a plane so small as this.
It drew her out.
Three hundred years of waiting for nothing.
When had this begun?
The thought horrified her.
Someone could get in.
Doubt about herself, Cordelia realized.
The promise of death.
ooh, that hurt. That hurt.
That was exactly what danger lay in.
Such memories had to be a curse.
There was too much blood.
A nice, profound breath.
It was clearer now.
And it would die to protect him.
Could have taken seconds or minutes.
This was living or dying.
They seemed to speak to him, if only in his imagination.
It was like lamb for slaughter.
The signs were all there.
I thought about Danny.
All I did was savor the night air.
The thought of demons came to him then.
There was too long.
A forbidden love she let slip through her fingers.
It couldn't go on.
It was good to be awake.
No. It had just come.
There was nothing to fear here.
It was a moment.
Actually, it was paradise.
And wanted to shake the Chinaman.
Across the shadows, the light.
A reminder of my ebbing fertility.
He waited no longer.
She thought of flying back.
To die, to sleep. No more.
And inside, he waited on it.
Life no longer had any meaning.
Something was in here.
A terrible, dangerous secret that must never be told.
But whatever was happening would happen at its own pace.
As if life itself was one giant press conference.
So she might have suffocated.
Tried to focus on the computer screen.
That, too, was a small solace.
Absurdly, it touched him.
A dying desire to kill it.
Still no sign of pursuit.
And unfamiliar emotions began to stir.
And threatened to kill even more.
A dance with the stars.
It was a moment.
He knew what awaited him.
The perfect night for secrets and horror.
Something locked away deep inside.
It had to go.
There wasn't a way back.
Pure animal instinct took over.
Her mind refused to speculate.
And it was in the air, everywhere.
It demanded her attention.
But it was close.
How long would it take him to pull through?
And with it, the heat.
This was good land, he thought.
Yet he could still move.
They were in this chamber.
A long, long pause.
The sun and the stars.
Laughter lurked in his voice.
Scarves from Paris, pure silk.
It spoke more and more.
The killer was killing again.
And this had happened many times.
It seemed so close to her.
Sleep was completely impossible.
There wasn't a way back.
Almost like weighing someone's soul.
A dark stage, a single spotlight.
Like a siren's song.
"My office," she said.
It lifted them up like some crazy, wonderful elevator.
Each second counts, doesn't it?
It was her daydream.
It spoke to me.
And then there was no more room for thought.
Anything that could fly him home.
Like two mighty overlords taking turns in a constant cycle.
But the signs were there.
It was close enough to touch.
It had to happen so fast.
Everything since then, almost a decade of his life, pivoted on those few minutes.
There could be predators around.
Fast, while the dancing idiot distracted them.
There was fury, fighting, But it was true.
Not just one thing, but a world of possibilities.
The thought horrified him.
And it felt love at first sight.
A rose and a crown.
No, she thought, I don't know now. It had been a dream.
He knew precisely what awaited him.
His hand still held her, she realized.
He wondered what it would bring to this fated night.
Uncertainty flickered in Brian's eyes.
No wonder it had tracked them so easily.
Just a matter of enough light.
What had he feared?
For the first time, it seemed something humanly possible.
They regarded each other.
But it was better in here.
Maybe he just stirred.
Alcohol shielded her from surprises.
It was underneath him.
A deadly vanity that brought him nothing.
It had been too long a night.
There was no joy to it.
The moon affects her as it does a woman, he thought.
No wonder she strayed.
Life seemed only a preparation for hell.
Silence in the speeding car.
She uttered the word she feared.
Something could still happen.
From the blue sky.
It was taking too long.
He wanted to die.
It was too far.
Yet- "Do not move," he said, rising.
It returns to me.
It touched him too hard.
Just a prick of the finger. A few drops of blood.
A walk in the rose orchard.
How could it pass in that short period of time.
It was giving him strength.
She wanted to burn them to the ground.
A diseased, dangerous place.
It was clearly here.
His hands rested on her shoulders.
No, passing through the pain.
There was no other way back.
It was already here.
Little black boots on low heels.
He glanced about the schoolyard for a while, and thought.
"Please," she murmured, not stirring to rise.
A precious birthright that might be discovered on a forbidden world.
As if a new part of your heart was opening.
They got inside me.
Anger and disappointment radiated from him.
It was fighting for her.
Secrets long hidden spilled out as they sought to impress her with their cleverness.
Like a dream, a beautiful dream that came true.
Suddenly he was solid.
Then he came again.
It felt good and he burned with a desire to kill, to destroy.
A heart as large as the world.
It spoke to me.
This is how our bodies weaved.
How was I supposed to know what awaited me?
Guilt took hold of me again.
A life dream hanging by a thread.
It seemed to be waiting with her.
It defined itself through him.
Only where it sat.
It was food for thought.
Only the wind, Bryce told himself.
Yet there was no real danger.
Almost like a fairy tale.
Mating with Tarablilliast had never been so intense.
And she told herself there'd be no snow.
The words reminded him of the Berkshire.
It was here in this house.
Pedal-controlled, like a bike.
He thought of the Dark Queen, able to enter the world at last.
Morning on the beach.
It was here, no question.
The moment was ripe.
Nothing to compel her to keep going.
They tasted each other.
It could take longer.
A bird on a ladder.
Maybe they prized comfort.
The time was right.
Again she kissed him.
There was familiarity now.
And that frightened him.
Severe, beautiful and timeless, with a single reminder of mortality.
He let the voices in.
I heard my own breath, tried to suppress it.
Someone was searching for something.
Words had to be wrung from him.
He wanted that pen.
Someone could open it.
He imagined what might be there.
I opened the door, stepped inside.
It was the waiting.
The acknowledgment came back, impersonal and uninterested.
Slightly less staccato in that last rhythm.
In that cavern beneath the temple.
Had something new occurred?
My hand rested on his wrist.
The reassurance gave him a new hold on his world.
Hey, it still could.
Solution was so simple.
The firewall to the black box.
It was so close.
No, but it had been young and fresh.
He breathed into me.
A wolf who would die where it stood rather than be driven further.
Tiny glimmer of hope.
It was like being in a dentist's chair.
It was there still.
Like he was riding a metal horse.
The madness of a man splitting in half.
It was so temptingly near.
Almost as if someone was messing with destiny.
It was tempting to step outside the house.
Just a little longer in the moonlight.
But it seemed to work.
It pulled at something deep inside him.
Speed to seize the moment.
It came to me out of nowhere.
As he was when his heart went dark.
Nothing can hold me here.
Didn't feel like a dream.
Death shouldn't reach me without him.
Bringing an end to hunger.
The sheer wrongness of it assaulted his soul.
The time was right.
His head shook, clearing it.
Each touched, yet never overlapped.
The time had come to play a game.
Only half imagined, half dreamed.
But she was still alive, and that felt good.
Still a story without end.
He knew what awaited him.
It seemed like fate.
What else in the world was there?
Letting it flow through me like a river.
Hardness returned to her voice.
The swans were right. Time to join their kind.
He had no idea what awaited him.
Like trying to swim through a barrel of syrup.
It was time, at last.
Still smoldering, all day, surprising.
Still, the thought frightened her.
Everything seemed clear - distinct - certain.
Experience had taught him.
Absence didn't make the heart grow fonder; it created a kind of magnetic lock that didn't seem humanly possible to break.
Soft light and music.
She sat in bed, her elbows resting against her knees.
Like a hurricane of bullets.
A walk through the rose garden.
It was like being pushed into a hole.
What had made them halt so suspiciously?
The firewall to the black box.
Something else was looming.
If only it had not to end.
He dreaded losing her.
He was almost home.
Yet a sense of resignation surrounded him.
It seemed possible, but little likely.
It was like a power surge, an overdose of adrenaline.
Not without the evening and the flowers.
A room in a high tower.
It read her thoughts, understood her intent.
Probably until he stopped thrashing.
Every detail unfolded before him.
The dark side of the moon.
They might come later.
Elegant, calm, and homelike in a pitch-black forest.
It seemed a little slow.
It looked at him.
The sweetness of a newborn daughter held in his arms.
Cloaking, in all its glory.
Dirty harry into her brain.
Banishment was a blessing.
And for an instant it was as it used to be.
And yet he kept walking.
The polite words were mockingly spoken, filled with the hissing heat of the threat.
Saw the seal in the table.
Sex and death seemed too close-connected, somewhere in the bottom of his brain.
As if he was asleep in the sunshine.
She lay here, as she did now.
Could one lie with thoughts?
Impelled her to eat more.
While the sparks were still glowing, he already glorified that temporary peace.
Steel was made there, wasn't it?
To rise from the dead.
Because when the shift came, confusion would follow.
It was still there.
A moment of incredible agony.
His heart was stone.
Maybe he had dreamed that kiss.
Anger at herself gave her courage.
My hand hesitated on the doorknob as an effort to lengthen the moment.
How many would be dead tomorrow?
Suspicion took hold of him.
He could feel the vibrations in his chest.
Or was there a fundamental component of it that persisted?
Slashed the belts, the pipes.
How weak it made him feel.
She beckoned to him.
Because the moon told me so.
The Queen might be near.
Secret steel, gripping him so gently.
Gunfire and the smell of gasoline.
And they were consuming him.
It seemed as inevitable as the winding down of his biological clock.
Switching to night lights.
How would it feel to be free again?
The car was a definite hint.
Like watching two other humans drink.
It felt the same.
It felt nice to run like this.
The irony of her words clenched his bowels.
The Watch had been here.
He was almost there.
It was like a knife thrust into her lower back and twisted.
Graceful like a swan.
Rage, and behind it, fear.
She paid no attention to the water dripping from her onto the carpet.
They would grok together.
Life, it seemed, still had the capacity to surprise.
Love had yet to be taught.
Anger swelled again, and with it the first seeds of rebellion stirred in his heart.
There was that strange sense of coming home.
Approaches made her nervous.
And yet it happened.
Blood was good fertilizer, wasn't it?
Too much to hear.
Yet there was purpose to this seeming madness.
A solid table, a solid pair.
No, no, no, just enough to heal her.
Still he commanded himself to breathe.
For the first time, there was nothing serene about it.
It came to me deep in the night, as it so often does.
A golden compass. And it showed them all that was hidden.
He beckoned to himself.
This was good land, he thought, not for the first time.
It was too long now.
There seemed no emotion to it.
The road to ruination.
For a moment it had its charm.
It was a moment.
The oasis of calm in a busy airport terminal.
Not with the force required to break off a knife on Walt's spine.
The turn outside, not in.
Another day, perhaps, but not today.
Made of metal, tore off the wind.
As though love itself were a plague.
What was holding them up?
There wasn't a way back.
He'd only wanted to touch her. But she screamed.
It was as if the world had been the surface of a flag and someone had unfurled it with an angry snap.
An unexpected sense of dread swept over him.
Conditioned his dog to salivate at the sound of a bell.
Conflicting emotions were thrashing through Ben.
As if it were uncorrupted by the world.
A hard curtain, he thought.
Similars attract themselves, she thought.
But there was no freedom.
But hope gleamed in his eyes.
I kissed him, david.
As if someone knew what it was.
Someone was telling a joke.
It felt as though someone had put a fist into his stomach.
Three hundred years of waiting, for nothing.
Not yet. Too many civilians.
It gave him a grim pleasure.
No wonder they were scarce.
But it seemed to work.
A promise of the sudden cessation of questions, yet there were no answers waiting beyond.
Fear of what would await me.
But nervousness boiled inside him.
The scope of it threatened to overwhelm him.
Two seconds, just came.
He stared at me, still holding, but his flesh spoke for him.
They seemed larger, somehow.
Not that he expected the castle cuisine to work.
An awkward silence fell between us.
Like a squirrel trying to comprehend the wolf.
A taste of the fresh wound in your throat.
Too much was happening too fast.
I wanted to run.
A constant smile above the starched collar of the shirt.
It was too strong.
Something exchanged in the rhythm of the individual.
Red carpet in the hall.
A story no one could get.
All the rest was held between them, spinning in fragile complexity.
The thought frightened her.
A knife to the heart.
The comer of his mouth rose.
I knew what awaited me.
It could be a day.
It held me in place.
Currently, other passions were writhing through him.
Yet Dawson was coming.
Something has to give.
She felt charged again.
No, really. This time it wasn't a nightmare.
There wasn't a way back.
Some important light flickered in his head, and the liquor slowed his thought.
It had no meaning.
One refused to rise to the bait, lurking in the depths.
Like a spring day in England.
And something could snap its fingers and say, no, it has to be this way.
I took deep breaths, exhaled slowly.
Like someone was calling him.
Anger touched him again, but he fought it down.
A prisoner encased in stone and twisted steel.
She beckoned to him.
But it had value.
But for now, he permitted himself the pleasure.
Like someone shredded them with their bare hands.
There was no way back.
It might be days.
There was almost a fairy quality to this place, he thought.
It could do so again.
A boat on a tree.
The wind whirled dust and sand around them while she weighed his words.
How deep had he come?
If the chair were cold.
Up and down, back and forth, faster, faster.
Like drinking from a puddle.
Odd that the traveling had brought me here.
The thought of her dying made him shiver.
Anger was literally wrenching through Duncan.
She had no idea what awaited her.
A woman in chains, waiting for her destiny.
And then it was like seeing it again.
She thought of nothing else.
A very well-stocked fortress.
And it was starving.
What were they doing when pain presented?
What need was there for it?
Crawling wasn't graceful, or sensuous, but this was.
The grandest game there was.
Not counting the forty-five minutes they circled the airport, waiting to land.
But it seemed more appropriate to walk.
Silence like a funeral.
It was going too easily.
If only it could go so easily.
Star on the rise.
And it almost touched me.
A feeling more beautiful, more pure, more sacred.
Nothing ever lurked for me.
There was a grotesque fascination that couldn't be denied.
Like a day or two mattered.
Savor the view, savor the moment.
How it would feel to fly.
He crossed the safety line.
Something has to give.
It was a long, tense wait.
Revenge shouldn't know the bonds.
Ah, the empty room above her garage.
Knocked on his door, no answer.
It was true, but the thought of pulling out the chair filled her with weary gloom.
Only minutes separated them now.
Almost as if someone Had been tied up and Struggled to get free.
The deadly, deadly source.
Came from his mouth.
It was a nudge.
She could close an eye.
All the signs were there.
Nine hundred miles of fence separating them.
And this place, the place where it had begun.
It was here in this house.
Almost as if it aged a century in just the past few minutes.
Too much wildness lies within him.
Like an animal in the woods, faced with its first human being.
What was drawing him away?
Like the whole world was coming at me.
A feeling more beautiful, more pure, more sacred.
Why did his stomach twist?
He wished to touch it.
Like a single-stinged bee.
Two warriors locked in battle, fighting for honor.
He exhaled, and it came almost in relief.
A new order of the world.
What could Hell do?
Morning will tell, he thought.
He thinks, lost in the passageway.
It carried me here.
Still a story without end.
That seemed like foreboding.
Launching a little steam.
The ever-repeating pattern struck her as interesting and reassuring.
Yet it seemed to matter.
Her phones were tapped. Illegally.
Like it was resetting.
A cave of wonder.
But her body had ripened, filled out with a promise which had been only hinted at before.
Then perhaps it could be quiet.
A sight to warm the heart.
Just as evening touches night.
His shoulders told him.
The thought of the pain made her shiver.
Man in the sky, everlasting life.
It couldn't go on.
They stared up at him.
The sight touched me.
The anger drained from me.
He squeezed her shoulders.
Never too late to savor life.
It was too long.
Nightmarish, yes, but not a nightmare.
A spiral, pinpointing this place.
Words hurt too much.
And lofty and flowing.
She seized a moment.
She bit him, piece by piece, and imagined that the seed was a whole meal.
Like standing in a terminal waiting to choose my destination.
There were spikes in that answer.
That nourished her heart.
It was a certainty, suddenly.
Perhaps it was intelligible.
They had forsaken me, he thought.
A feeling that emanates from the pit of hell.
Killing him did nothing.
It seemed to be.
It was like shooting fish in a vat.
And he knew the agony a hardwood bolt would cause him.
Like beasts, whipping us into submission.
The man banged out script after script. Movie after movie.
But there was hope.
Like an oasis in a vast desert or an island in a stormy sea.
Anger seized him, but it was a confused anger.
It was the perfect first kiss. Snow.
Like living into the tempest of a woman's heart.
Anger and futility, long held back in him, sought their way out.
The words were sharp, bitter.
And it could fall.
Her stomach lifted as the airplane started down.
And yet, all this seemed so real.
They seek to trap me, the Druid thought suddenly.
More like a strong vibration.
She wriggled up the bed, inviting him into her.
Too rich for my blood.
And it wouldn't stop here.
The wine seemed to relax him.
Yes, indeed. The circle of life.
Greta seduced a small smile.
Like a QWERTY keyboard.
Daylight, harnessed as a weapon.
The size of the world.
Funny what calm could come out of such a crazy pot of bewilderment and dread.
And it did not easing at all.
It still seemed much too close.
The warmth of human contact with a manly whiff of violence.
Now it was almost his.
This was still the hospital.
Something was still happening.
Not in its most urgent hour of need.
And yet they were too real.
Everything would pass through control.
Beating like a schoolboy's.
I closed my eyes.
It was lovely, like a dream.
Doubt had replaced conviction.
Like an emergency landing, he thought.
I wanted to touch cristina.
Something stuck in my throat.
It could last for days.
For a moment they almost seemed to waltz.
And they kept walking.
It wanted to stop them.
It was so moving.
Her touch was pleasant, soft.
Looking out over the bars of a prison,
How long ago it seemed.
Yes, strong enough to stir the moon.
It was like a light at the end of a tunnel.
As though it had been scalded.
Was this surrender, then?
As if swallowed by the earth.
What did it matter what lay on the other side of the world?
The change from man to beast.
Until the desire to kill overwhelmed him.
What that feels like touching her skin.
His head ached, and he wanted to leave.
It seemed less and less real.
Like a blade of grass trying to withstand a hurricane.
A sharp call, a challenge.
Enough for several more hours.
It was too near.
Movement in the hallway.
The sunrise of a new world.
She breathed in and out slowly.
Forever could be a curse.
An iron hand in a velvet glove.
I want to fly there, toward that boundary.
It was like watching someone kick a dog.
She could dare to dream.
She clung to him.
He could see her long dark lashes even across the room.
He wanted to walk.
It was too much longer.
He wanted it to stretch out.
Toasts at hunting must be short. Like a command. Like a shot.
No telling where those reserves might be hidden.
Blamed me for an open window, a closed window.
I dreamt of this moment.
Thinking of silk ties and tailor-made clothes.
So close, yet far away.
Quiet, there could be more.
The thunder in the jungle.
She stared down at the interlaced bodies.
It came at him in stark simplicity.
She stepped to the desk instead, her palm sliding slowly across the rough surface.
Only the business of breathing.
She brewed her coffee.
Just in the hungry storms.
It was coming home.
Some kind of heat.
As if he had slipped in through some crevice in time.
A quick lunge, inside and out, inside, out.
Pressing his hands on the car seat, he hopped in.
I knew exactly what awaited me.
It was like balm.
It felt like a warning.
And stabbed directly through the heart.
And the threat was about to grow rapidly
Two heartbeats and it had happened.
It was like putting on familiar flesh.
A childbirth was coming.
Yet it tempted him.
Felt like the end of the world.
But they could fear.
I wanted to melt in.
I slid in and out.
Just as business had learned to do with products.
Had so many of them ever attacked before?
He ruffled her hair.
How good and easy it would be to sit on that pavement.
It came to me like a bus in the street.
Something magic was happening, he thought.
Because he came black.
What was taking them so long?
It had to go deeper than here.
It hung in his head like an unsatisfied habit.
Not even a cockroach would kill.
I knew exactly what awaited me.
She clung to him.
It was within his grasp.
There was a desperate need of it.
The fire or the wind.
Almost without a stop.
He grimly forced himself back into reality.
Like two hounds fighting for an old slipper.
Like it was choking to death.
A wave of terrible disgrace coursed through him, but also excitement.
Walking into a lion's den of corner offices and corporate hubris.
The moment had arrived.
Somehow it was making her fury solid.
There was no way back.
Both hands settled on her shoulders.
Her tongue was ringed.
How delicious was this simple relaxation.
Heat and bondage, the latest craze.
It was here already.
Easy like pushing knobs.
Had to wrap her legs.
As if there was no war.
The sun and the moon.
As if wild animals had attacked her.
It was coming for them.
Not that the word night had any meaning here at the extremity of time.
It was like being inside a long treasure box.
He fought a moment with sudden, startling hope.
Softer than a virgin's thighs.
The hard, dark eyes softened.
Pure as the driven snow.
The signs were all there.
His heart beat, he took a quick breath.
He strode the length of the room and back, letting himself cool.
And it was impossible to move.
Up, up into the heavens.
Both sides together, steady.
Wondering what the next 729 days had in store.
Like salted tea with butter.
His relief still radiated from him.
He'd only wanted to touch her. But she screamed.
As if the killer had been scraping his hand against the grate of the fireplace or the stove during the game.
All it needed was thrust.
It was a love-ring, and that scent would always remain.
A breath of fresh air.
As if it were a triumphal procession.
A shot to the belly.
How cruel to make them wait so long.
It was like the sound of ho-kay.
Had to be a purpose to step into this tiny space.
Burning, burning in the flame
The sound of her Voice.
The alcohol I'd drunk pounded like a mace in my brain and in my heart.
Tried, but in vain.
Triggering the curse actually settled me down.
A long, long time to eat.
As if some terrible truth had been visited upon them.
He wanted to die.
All the power was in her hands.
And it also disturbed.
The last was spoken softly.
Not the biggest surprise that awaited them here.
It was here now.
Anticipation stirred as he watched her scan the midday diners, but another, unexpected element tugged at his attention.
The very thought moved him to gloomy rage.
It had to come.
Should have been the sights and sounds and smells of battle.
And beyond it, a folded place.
He ruffled her hair.
Yet it moved him.
It couldn't be controlled.
They were prophetic words.
It meant the city.
It crawled uneasily through his thoughts, rousing ugly suspicions.
Mixing a drink, he gazed through the doorway into his miniature patio.
Then subjectivity set in with a rush.
Not that the ugliness had suddenly become beautiful.
Stiff as a cane, cold as marble.
It felt threatening and out of scale.
It won over me.
Singing from beneath the ground.
Like a burning fire.
The temptation came close to overwhelming him.
"Nice place," he said, then caught a delicious aroma floating in from the kitchen.
Happiness stood by her.
For once, something spontal.
Felt it like a sting of treason.
That seemed to be said from the heart.
Forcing himself to reach out and touch one of the branches.
And what came out in between seemed to jump around, sometimes bewilderingly.
He raised a glass of wine and allowed himself a gulp.
The thought awakened him.
All I wanted was to sip morning espresso next to a peaceful, burbling fountain.
So soft, like a padded animal.
Like clockwork, never a minute more.
Shock pulse strong enough to make it happen.
The moon, the moon, the moon.
The last dance was coming.
All the signs were there.
Anger blazed in his eyes.
You're exhaling my air.
But thought of him recurred, and each time there was a hot commotion in her breast hard to stifle.
Jealousy burst out of him like a flash.
Fear of the cylon.
Sword of frosty light.
Victory for the overlord.
Anger had given way to sorrow.
The words of his own echoed back to him.
Felt like a janitor who was being summoned to clean up all the necessary dirt.
"No, you did not," and her laughter boomed.
To a freshly single pauly.
Not an end, but a beginning.
Pride stirred inside him.
The man was coming.
Trying to imagine what kind of monster would have done that.
Slashed my throat, ear to ear.
Another wave of tension flooded him.
He felt it -- whatever it was -- push against him.
The unwise, emotional fury of one who had cruelly wasted his life filled him.
A conscience echoed in him.
Like some demon ate him from the inside out.
He could think no more.
I wanted to scream.
A whole day scouring Third Earth.
An unreasonable anger took hold of him.
When all was ready again, a powerful sense of satisfaction washed over him.
Her hands burrowed at his shirt buttons.
Laughter as she fumbled beneath layered sweaters.
"Read thou my heart." She beguiled him.
He repeated the word idly, inwardly.
Drifting badly to the left.
A checkup could come in.
Shook his head, but he edged forward toward the long bar.
Christmas had come. Officially.
He stared at the clasped hands.
Something has to give.
Worry tainted his voice for the first time.
Like steam, for instance, coming out of a kettle.
The word was almost whispered.
But it could still change.
Gods couldn't be this cruel.
Like the breath had been knocked out of him.
His anger seized him for a moment.
Mouse and the word Mouse told him.
One of them bubbled to my lips now, but I held my tongue.
How would they find their way here?
But he couldn't last forever.
The thought horrified him.
It could kill him.
Words hung in the air between them.
Very unpleasant, as if someone were staring at me.
A careful taste confirmed it.
Graceful like a swan.
Too close for comfort. Sound a red alert.
Still in the wind.
Something wrong, but the danger meant less with every passing moment.
No, the smoke would have been black.
Disorientation, the smell of scorching hair.
There was something about peace, he imagined.
It was like seeing a teeny, tiny piece of the future.
Not a smart idea with darkness coming.
As if a band of Hell's Angels had picked this particular spot to crash for the night.
My hand rested on her arm.
How many more had to die before you'd stop?
Come to me, it had whispered.
Soft, warm, a little like being a young boy in a bakery very early in the morning.
As if she longed for faith.
Oh, my Gods. This could be the end of the cylons entirely. Forever.
No more blind alleys.
"When the moon rises," he said.
The pity made it final somehow.
He knew what lay below.
It seemed too much this time.
I wanted to crack the ice.
For a moment there it was very close.
I wanted to walk.
His breath could clear the store.
I could, and it was cold and full of warning.
Escape this way seemed impossible.
So there was hope.
A worm bowing to the sun.
And filled it with his blood.
Just getting through the day was a triumph.
The answer only whispered.
Feeding off it somehow.
As real as a rope knotted around a young girl's white neck.
One breath upon the other.
But, somehow, he squeezed himself into those new leather pants.
She clung to him.
Impressions crowded in on him.
To lift the seeping stain of ancient blood.
And like a wind out of the dark: Steady, sweet.
As if death hadn't had enough.
And it took him under.
When she opened, lust overcame him.
It was here in this house.
He seemed to think.
To sit in a cave, far above.
It seemed now as if it might be.
It felt better to run than answer the phone.
No. Not a hospital.
Not in its most urgent hour of need.
Contempt for the Galactics filled him.
"I was taught to hate," he mused, listening to the rustle of small animals, the bird calls he'd never truly heard until now, never truly forgotten.
But, inexplicably, it still called to him.
The picture was bright in his mind.
It was almost restful.
The inhalations that lifted their chests, beginning with the tiny movements of fingertips, imitated the other.
Not thought-- more like instinct.
"All flesh is grass." He said it.
The words flowed as if he had waited a decade to speak them.
No leap to the roof across the street.
But it could be time-sliding.
It had just been born.
His hand reached out toward her.
He let himself out.
And unfamiliar emotions began to stir.
A warning from the gods.
A man's voice that said it loved you.
He couldn't stifle a howl, but hoped the music would drown it.
Nothing could hold me.
Like a magic carpet.
Row after row, like a flowery spool.
The endless procession to the guillotine.
Promises made metaphorical hands shook.
But when she came, it was like a battering ram.
She clung to him.
Every detail had its place here.
It could take longer.
But the explanation rang hollow.
I thought long and hard.
The clothes around me were distracting.
Once more, from the top, with feeling.
And for the second time a bleak certainty of his own approaching death filled him.
Watching from a distance.
Tumbling through the veins like a pebble in a river.
They stripped away the lies.
And worse again, wrenching up the intensity.
It's coming to me.
She could sense it waiting.
His sins caught up with him.
Just a few more steps, just a few more.
He dreaded what was coming.
It was near, nothing more.
There was only the panting of her breathing.
As if the dream had come true.
A fleeting memory of the erotic dream from which he'd awoken this morning warmed his face.
Like someone inside was pinching her.
And as I toddled, I pondered.
Yet calm rattled nerve.
I wanted to go deeper, to that warm leather, to sink my fangs into the meat, to taste whatever was under.
It was like sleeping next to a body they dragged out of a river.
Anger gave her strength.
Not with a whimper. But with a bang.
In those moments, she mocked herself sharply.
Another burst of gunfire.
Like a big ship leaving a pier.
True love was calling.
They were beyond the pale.
It would sort itself out.
Only retreat made sense.
Until he climbed the other side.
Yeah, clark could do that.
Exposing them to the energy harnessed in that chamber above.
His head fell into his palms.
Almost as if the knife had caused no harm.
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.
I let out the superheated air, shuddered, tried to think practically.
A scream in the darkness.
"Somewhat," he said, and forced stiff muscles to set him upright.
The words simply flowed.
It blew out of him before he could stop himself.
He wanted to hold the spell.
It seemed to work.
It passed before her like the promise of her own death, hinting, teasing, and whispering silent threats.
Maybe green already did.
Fingers crossed for the last one.
Nick thought about it.
Not with the spirits of nature at her side.
This was no different than the pre-awakening days at the Sisterhood's Keep, Duncan thought.
Not as close as meredith.
Up and down, back and forth, faster, faster.
Please. My insides hurt.
As if she could flow through my fingers.
She closed her eyes.
It had been too long a night.
Her life, marching slowly into the arms of death.
Little touch of electricity.
"You came for me," she said, her voice echoing through a tunnel of bewilderment.
The time had come again.
Was there supposed to be a way out?
Astonishing, he thought, the tyranny exerted over the body by the mind.
It might last longer.
It was almost over now.
Unbidden, a wave of homesickness washed over him, as had often happened in this last week.
A speeding car, and the way the agents responded to it, quickened the heartbeat.
And entering the ground, heavier than slipping a thread through a needle.
A little intimate illumination, a little romantic dinner.
A squealing rat in a cop's borrowed suit.
A victory awaited him.
Lifted me as if I were a baby.
It was the room.
Accusing fingers pointed at him from all sides.
Something came between them, something cold and silent that knocked his breath away.
He stripped her clothes.
His hands held her face, straightened her hair, smoothed her cheeks.
Allowing his unraveled self to knit slowly back together.
Was just the touch in fingers.
Skittering away, again and again, from thoughts too bitter with irony to contemplate.
It struck him at once.
Mary should be protected. Hidden.
Drinking only made this worse.
He vanished, and I paced.
He spoke the word within the silence of his mind.
Not thinking, yet not dreaming.
Exquisite concentration radiated from the room.
The moon, the moment.
His fingers pressed against my lips, quieting me.
The sense of freedom was heady, dangerous.
A hot, caffeinated beverage.
A life, waiting to be lived.
Suddenly none of it seemed to matter.
Could be nothing, could be the end of the world.
"Penny for your thoughts," she whispered.
Inside, she was smiling, and that thought faded.
Anger flared in me.
Real curiosity seized her.
Thought of the Grantline Moon Expedition stabbed at me.
It could take forever.
Sleep is seizing me, ma'am.
A manoeuvre of distraction.
Dougal, that nightmare again.
It was like seeing.
Could be a week, could be a month.
Explosion like this, had to be.
And worse than peril.
Like two cars that hooked bumpers, pushing and pulling at wrong times.
She flung herself toward him.
Curiosity prodded her, mulling on his words.
The moon, the stars.
They squeezed closer together.
Just like it, baby - wild and rocky and wide open.
Nowhere left to run, nowhere left to hide.
She felt astonishingly peaceful.
It was funny, too, up here on the not-so-funny top of Cal­ifornia and in all that rushing fog.
A sense of victory came over him again.
It was ending now.
Rocked La Motta to his heels.
And the sacrifice had been made.
Another minute or so.
Her hand touched his shoulder lightly.
It could be days.
Behind him, round the corner.
Ghoulish, spoken far too fast.
What demon could be so beautiful.
On no levels was it right.
It was up and down.
Loud and steady, varying the slightest bit.
It was quiet. Respectful.
Remorse threatened to overwhelm her.
With the honey-maned dragon, whose eyes dance with insanity.
It was like being put to bed after early supper.
There would be coffee beside him, the last of an endless chain of cups.
"Plant the seeds. "In the fields and levees.
An exchange from an old movie clanged stupidly into his mind.
He should've expected the tension to diminish after the ritual in which he'd apparently - though unwillingly - participated; but the air was even more charged than before.
If only the bell would stop ringing.
And that was a dread.
Coming from the Darkness.
Now it was time to dance.
A heavy thing, to be denied its warmth.
Someone was speaking to him.
The shower, this unremitting heat.
Every bit of her med-tech training cried out against this.
Still there, but it had the other side.
There was no way out.
Like a child into the cool remnant of a dream.
Slowly with the gloat.
I longed to penetrate it.
Each kill seemed more thrilling, more paralyzingly delicious than the one which had gone before.
My imagination had other things to do.
Like a couple of scarecrows after a thunderstorm.
That's what happiness felt like.
Even our exercise last night stabbed me.
Interest roused in him.
Like two beasts about to come face to face.
It was like searching for a needle in a stack of hay.
Hope the metal frame grounds her.
And it was odd how luck had ruled.
It felt ready - almost eager -for release.
Rabban bubbled with anticipation.
It prickled at her nerves.
Maybe it was London.
Oh, yes. Every story had an ending.
As if it had been here all along, just below the surface, waiting for a kind of mental puberty.
Except the inevitable march of time.
Nothing but peace and quiet.
Was that merry? Terrible.
What the hell was going on in this nightmare?
A little hostility clinked in it.
No. Only when you screamed.
It took more persuasion.
I panted sharply, my eagerness painfully strong.
It was the waiting.
Like a city on wheels.
A crack yawned in her serenity, but she schooled herself into calm.
With the sun and the moon under them.
Man, it spoke to me.
In astonishment, he stared at the hand, the hand of a female.
Adoration was a beginning before beginning.
And gave back all that blood mingled with his own.
His palm felt like a soldier's: hard and callused.
A heavy thing, to be denied its warmth.
Crazier than a fish swimming through grass.
Something else fretted him.
My whole body vibrated with it.
It could kill him.
Anger spoke out of me.
Could life get any better?
He bubbled too much.
The idea of Rose's changing enough to walk out of the house with his goddam ATM card took hold again in his mind, took hold in a gnawing, beavery way he could hardly stand.
He thought of the hours now, and the smell of a kind of unfamiliar happiness seemed to be spreading from them.
The voices told him to.
It was too far away.
An explosion waiting to happen.
And that was when emotions reawakened in her.
Holding it was like being refreshed by a dipper of well-water on a hot day.
It was an idea whose time had come again.
There was no parting them.
Danced night and day.
I thought of a romantic dinner by candlelight, by wine.
It could take forever.
Her tone summoned obedience.
Curiosity aroused in him, apparently.
I slipped in and out.
Too bad it was so close.
He feared so much.
Even so, it had no meaning.
The thought held on to him forever.
Just a small slam.
A beautiful bouncing shot.
Just a flash of chaos and surprise.
Please. My insides hurt.
Dismissing them, he wandered across the huge new compound.
And then it kicked in.
Like a man shouting without a sound.
My hands slid over the bare skin of his stomach.
A fierce grin stretched his lips, echoed out of his deep eyes.
It was like getting a splash in the eyes from a squirtgun loaded up with battery acid.
The far corners of the earth.
Like a bird that flies into the room.
The thought kept returning.
"That answers that," Eller thought grimly, as the lift rose around him.
But now it seemed too strange and sudden.
A little something called vengeance.
She had no idea what awaited her.
He didn't have time to breathe.
A relief for a weary body.
It felt incontrovertibly right in his mind.
It was too far.
Random, but it hurt.
But the rage kept coming back.
It was hanging here.
It was as if something sat on his chest.
He was cloaked in glory.
It was a word without meaning.
But there wasn't a way back.
An eternity of misery and on and on.
Words moved from him.
